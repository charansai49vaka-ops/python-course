# Type casting is used to change the type of the one data type into another data type 
# data into another datatype
# for example 3 is a integer
# by using typecasting we can change the integer to any type we like
# 3 into float values and make it look like a float as 3.00



# int=18
# float= float(int)
# print(int)
# print(type(int))


# str_name= '10'
# sai= int(str_name)
# print(str_name)


string = '10'  # Use descriptive name to avoid shadowing
sai = int(string)
print(string)

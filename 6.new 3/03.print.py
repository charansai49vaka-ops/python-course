print statements are used to print any thing which we want
basically there we used print statements as print()
but there are different ways to use print statements in reality
1.print("sai charan")--now the outputr will be :   sai charan
2.print("sai","charan")--now output will be :  sai charan even though we written ,
in between them
3.print("sai charan",'vaka')--now output will be :  sai charan vaka
** we use two functions in print statements there are 
  1.sep(we can able to show what we want to write in between words)
  2. end(we can able to end the ending of the words as we want)

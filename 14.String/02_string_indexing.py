# String Indexing: string indexing is used to able to print a particular alphabet in a string 
# string indexing is started by using indexing like 
# for example: name="s a i c h a r a n"
                #    0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8
# this is how the indexing works
# if we add more indexing than the indexing present in the string then we will receive  a error 
# name="saicharan"   here indexing is 8
# print(name[9])  it will result ion error because we can't be abl;e to print because it doesn't have 9th indexing
name="sai charan"
print(name[0])   #here 0 is s
print(name[1])
print(name[2])
print(name[3])
print(name[4])       #we can able to print alphabets we want 
print(name[5])
print(name[6])
print(name[7])
print(name[8])
print(name[9])   #here 9 is n

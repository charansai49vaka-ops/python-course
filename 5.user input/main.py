# user input is taken from users
# for example : enter your name
# we take user input as using function
# input()
# The input which was taken by us is all ways in string
# to change its data type we have two kind of methods
# 1. by using typecasting 
# ex: sai=input("enter your name")   
#     b=int(sai)
#     print(b)
# After changing it by using another function l;ike b=,, then print the function 
# by using the letter or variable which are used by us
# these means name is converted into integer data type
# the other way is using the function starting while even taken the input type
# 2.  sai=int(input("enter your age"))
#     charan=inbt(input("enter your age"))
#     print(sai + charan)
# 



# sai=input("enter your age")
# print(sai)
# print(type(sai))



sai=input("Enter your age")
c=int(sai)
print(c)
print(type(c))
print(c + 3)
charan=input("enter your age")
s=int(charan)
print(s)
print(type(c))
print(c + s)

 
 
sai=int(input('enter your age'))
charan=int(input("enter your age"))
print(sai + charan)
